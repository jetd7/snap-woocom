## 1.0.2

- Security: Thank‚Äëyou redirect is now gated server‚Äëside. `/funded` only returns `order_received_url` when progress is FUNDED (0) or COMPLETE (30), or the order is already paid. Client redirects only when that URL is present.
- Client Guard: Removed UI fallback submission when finalize isn‚Äôt ready; checkout remains blocked with an inline message until funding completes.
- Order Resolution: Removed ‚Äúrecent Snap order‚Äù fallback from `/funded` to prevent cross‚Äësession reuse. Resolution now relies on session `order_awaiting_payment`, explicit `order_key`, and the signed cookie.
- Attach Behavior: No more draft‚Üípending promotion in `/attach`. Status changes happen only on FUNDED/COMPLETE.
- Progress 26 Handling: Note‚Äëonly (awaiting delivery); no status change.
- Observability: Added `funded_fetch_failed` and `funded_no_redirect` events to Woo logs for clear diagnostics.
- Version: Bumped to 1.0.2; assets use the version for cache‚Äëbusting.

## 0.5

## Architecture Overview

- Snap is a standard WooCommerce payment gateway with an eligibility/signing flow.
- Orders are created by WooCommerce; the plugin does not create new orders during finalize.
- Application IDs are attached to the current checkout order (latest in `_snap_application_id`, history in `_snap_application_ids`).
- Finalization is server-authenticated: the server calls Snap Status API and only returns a thank‚Äëyou URL for signed/complete states.

### Checkout Flow (Classic & Blocks)
- Customer selects Snap ‚Üí clicks ‚ÄúCheck eligibility‚Äù (opens Snap popup).
- Pre‚Äësign (approved/pending/docs): checkout remains blocked; inline messages guide the user.
- Signed (progress 26): server returns thank‚Äëyou URL; redirect to order confirmation; order is not marked paid; signed note added.
- Funded/Complete (progress 0/30): order is marked paid/complete; redirect to order confirmation.
- Declined/withdrawn/error: checkout remains blocked with clear messaging; merchant can switch methods.

### Endpoints and Security
- SDK URL (auto‚Äëselects by Test mode):
  - Sandbox: `https://sandbox-sdk.snapfinance.co.uk/v1/snapuk.min.js`
  - Production: `https://sdk.snapfinance.co.uk/v1/snapuk.min.js`
- REST
  - `POST /wp-json/snap/v1/attach` ‚Äî binds latest applicationId to the current draft order (no status promotion).
  - `POST /wp-json/snap/v1/funded` ‚Äî calls Snap Status API; returns thank‚Äëyou URL only for progress 26/0/30.
  - `GET /wp-json/snap/v1/status` ‚Äî server‚Äëverified application status.
  - `POST /wp-json/snap/v1/journey` ‚Äî optional stage logging (idempotent per stage).
- Security guards
  - REST nonces required for attach/funded/status/journey.
  - Finalize redirects only for progress ‚àà {26, 0, 30}. Client does not fallback‚Äësubmit when not ready.
  - No recent‚Äëorder fallback (prevents cross‚Äësession reuses). Resolution is session/order_key/cookie scoped.

### Status Mapping (Server)

| Code | Meaning                   | Order status change          | Order note                                                                                                      | Redirect? |

### Logs
- Unified CSV‚Äëstyle Woo logs (source `snap`) include: `order_created`, `attach_ok`, `funded_start/done`, `journey`, `status_polled/ok`.
- Additional hardening events:
  - `funded_fetch_failed` ‚Äî status fetch failed; finalize aborted.
  - `funded_no_redirect` ‚Äî non‚Äëfunded state; no thank‚Äëyou URL returned.

### Versioning and Cache Busting
- All enqueued assets include `SNAP_FINANCE_PLUGIN_VERSION` as a query param.
- Bump the plugin header version to force cache refresh after releases.

### Testing Checklist
- Toggle Test mode: confirm SDK host switches (sandbox/prod).
- Declined flow blocks checkout and logs notes.
- Pre‚Äësign approved keeps checkout blocked; no redirect.
- Signed (26) redirects; note added; no status change.
- Funded/Complete (0/30) marks paid/complete; redirects.
- Hammer ‚ÄúPlace order‚Äù cannot produce a thank‚Äëyou page unless signed/funded/complete.

- Security Hardening: Added nonce verification to wc-ajax `snap_save_application_cb`; removed insecure finalize AJAX (`ajax_mark_funded`) and consolidated on secured REST `/snap/v1/funded`.
- Code Cleanup: Removed deprecated `snap_seed_order` and duplicate class-based `handle_save_snap_application` to reduce redundancy.
- Audit Improvements: `/attach` now appends to `_snap_application_ids` while keeping the latest `_snap_application_id` for lookups.
- Robustness: Standardized localStorage keys to snake_case (`snap_application_id`, `snap_token`, `snap_application_status`, `snap_finance_approved`) and aligned Classic returning-customer detection.
- Finalize Robustness: Enhanced order resolution in `/attach` and `/funded` with pragmatic fallbacks (latest draft or most recent Snap order). Terminal guard preserved; no order creation in finalize.
- Observability: Added concise logs for fallback paths (`attach_fallback_recent`, `funded_fallback_draft`, `funded_fallback_recent`) to aid diagnostics without noise.
- Token Handling: Quiet rehydrate for expected 401s, plus a light pre-finalize token freshness check (status poll) to reduce `/funded` 401s.
# Snap Finance WooCommerce Plugin v1.0.0

A WordPress plugin that integrates Snap Finance UK's payment gateway with WooCommerce, allowing customers to apply for finance during checkout.

**Developed by:** James Doel  
**Company:** FinMatch  
**Website:** https://finmatch.co.uk  
**License:** GPL v2 or later

## ‚úÖ **Compatibility**

- **WordPress**: 5.8+ (Tested up to 6.6)
- **WooCommerce**: 6.0+ (Tested up to 9.1)
- **PHP**: 7.4+
- **HPOS**: ‚úÖ Fully compatible with WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview (Updated)**

Highlights in 1.0.0
- Denied finalize no longer fails with order_not_seeded: fallback to latest Blocks draft order
- Server mapping hardened: failed/cancelled orders are not upshifted by attach/funded
- Production Status API base set to `https://prod-api.snapfinance.co.uk` via dynamic test mode
- Fix: Orders that reach failed/cancelled are not bumped back to pending by attach/funded flows
- Enforcement: Server-side process_payment blocks UI placement unless FUNDED/COMPLETE; DENIED fails with notice
- API Base: Production calls use `https://prod-api.snapfinance.co.uk` when not in test mode
- Attach ‚Üí Enrich (no seed creation): The plugin no longer creates a new order onApplicationId. Instead it attaches Snap metadata to the existing Woo Blocks draft order.
- REST-first finalize: `POST /snap/v1/funded` verifies Snap status server‚Äëside and transitions the same order. Idempotent and never creates.
- Limits enforcement: Snap is hidden when total is outside ¬£250‚Äì¬£10,000 (Classic `is_available`, Blocks `is_active`). Frontend limits messaging removed; server finalize remains the final guard.
- Thank‚Äëyou page hardening: Blocks APIs are guarded so the order confirmation page doesn‚Äôt throw console errors.
- Server status logs and journey tracking added; DENIED maps to failed; PENDING_DEL note clarified; client sends DENIED to server without redirect.

## üß≠ Production diagnostics and logging

This plugin writes high‚Äësignal, token‚Äësafe diagnostics on both frontend and server. Use the guide below when supporting merchants.

| Source | Where to view | What it captures | PII/Security | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WooCommerce log: `snap` | WooCommerce ‚Üí Status ‚Üí Logs (select `snap`) | Server Status API replies (progressStatus), funded flow start/done, ATTACH outcomes, journey posts, idempotent finalizations, fallback to draft order | No bearer tokens; includes application_id, order_id, invoice_number | Trace application lifecycle; verify status mapping; ensure no duplicate orders; see which order finalized |
| WooCommerce log: `snap-finance` | WooCommerce ‚Üí Status ‚Üí Logs (select `snap-finance`) | Global order creation hook (‚ÄúOrder created #id (status, method)‚Äù) | No tokens | Detect unexpected order creation; correlate with attach/funded logs |
| WooCommerce log: `snap-debug` | WooCommerce ‚Üí Status ‚Üí Logs (select `snap-debug`) | Draft recovery warnings (e.g., total mismatches), attach/funded edge cases | No tokens | Investigate recovery logic and edge conditions |
| Order notes (per order) | Woo order admin ‚Üí Order notes | Human‚Äëreadable notes for Snap statuses (DENIED, PENDING_DEL, FUNDED, COMPLETE), journey labels (‚ÄúReached Snap income‚Äù) | No tokens | See exact status transitions and journey waypoints for a specific order |
| Order meta (per order) | Woo order admin ‚Üí Custom fields (or via code/DB) | `_snap_application_id`, `_snap_invoice_number`, `_snap_progress_status`, `_snap_journey_*` flags/timestamps, `_snap_journey_rows` array | Contains app ID/invoice; no tokens | Correlate with Snap; export journey footprints (CSV‚Äëfriendly) |
| REST route outcomes | Network logs / Woo logs above | `/wp-json/snap/v1/attach` ok/failed; `/wp-json/snap/v1/funded` success/idempotent/409 not seeded; `/wp-json/snap/v1/status` results | No tokens in logs; bearer used only server‚Äëside | Verify attach/finalize paths, confirm idempotency, ensure no cart‚Äëcoupled creation |
| Frontend console (SnapRender/Blocks) | Browser devtools on merchant site | Render steps, validation guards, overlay clicks, SDK readiness, auto‚Äëclick, limits messages | Tokens are NOT logged; app IDs may appear | Reproduce UI flows and SDK callbacks; validate guard behavior |
| Diagnostic Utils (manual/auto) | Run `snapDiagnostic()` in console; auto 10s diagnostic | Focus/cursor, DOM path, selectable elements, click diagnostics, focus remediation | No tokens | Troubleshoot UX issues (focus traps, click handling) |
| WooCommerce notices | Checkout UI | Decline message and ‚Äúcomplete your Snap application‚Äù warnings; limits messaging | End‚Äëuser only | Validate UX: declines blocked, pending not allowed, limits enforced |
| Web server access logs | Hosting/server logs | REST hits to `/wp-json/snap/v1/*`, timing, status codes | Standard web logs | Confirm traffic patterns and HTTP errors |

Security notes

- Frontend logging removes bearer tokens; server never logs tokens.
- Once an order is failed/cancelled, non‚Äëfunded updates only update meta/notes; status will not revert to pending/processing.

Optional exports

- Journey CSV: order_id with binary flags/timestamps can be exported from order meta (`_snap_journey_*`, `_snap_journey_rows`). A WP‚ÄëCLI export command can be added on request.

REST endpoints
- `POST /wp-json/snap/v1/attach` ‚Äî binds `application_id` (and `invoice_number`, `order_key`) to the current draft order. No creation.
- `POST /wp-json/snap/v1/funded` ‚Äî verifies with Snap, applies status/notes, and returns `order_received_url`. Idempotent.

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend (PHP)**
- **Main Plugin**: `snap-finance.php` - WordPress plugin initialization
- **Gateway Class**: `includes/class-wc-snap-finance-gateway.php` - WooCommerce payment gateway
- **Database**: Creates `wp_snap_application_details` table for tracking applications
- **SDK Loading**: Enqueues Snap Finance UK SDK in `<head>` when gateway is enabled

### **Frontend (JavaScript)**
- **Shared Renderer**: `assets/js/snap-render.js` - Single source of truth for Snap SDK rendering
- **Classic Driver**: `assets/js/checkout.js` - Handles Classic WooCommerce checkout
- **Blocks Driver**: `assets/js/blocks.js` - Handles WooCommerce Blocks checkout
- **Payment Method Detector**: `assets/js/payment-method-detector.js` - Detects active payment method, publishes selection events
- **Form Monitoring (jQuery-free)**: `assets/js/form-monitor-util.js` - Event-driven validation mirroring (Classic + Blocks)
- **Transaction Data**: `assets/js/transaction-data.js` - Build/validate Snap transaction object
- **Legacy Utilities**: `includes/diagnostic-utils.js` (not currently used)
- **Future Utilities**: `includes/snap-focus-guard.js` (available for modal focus management)

### **Architecture Benefits**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Only `snap-render.js` calls the Snap SDK
- **Thin Drivers**: `checkout.js` and `blocks.js` only handle their respective checkout types
- **Clean Separation**: No duplicate logic between Classic and Blocks implementations
- **Minimal Footprint**: Only essential files with clear responsibilities

## üîÑ UPDATED COMPREHENSIVE SNAP FINANCE PLUGIN FLOW (Chronological)

Phase 1: PHP Initialization (Page Load)
- Group 1: Credential lookup & test mode detection
  - 1.1 Test Mode Check ‚Üí `$this->testmode` in `includes/class-wc-snap-finance-gateway.php`
  - 1.2 Sandbox vs Live SDK URL selection ‚Üí `includes/class-wc-snap-finance-gateway.php`
  - 1.3 Credential assignment ‚Üí `$this->client_id`, `$this->merchant_id`
- Group 2: PHP-side transaction object creation
  - 2.1 Invoice number generation ‚Üí `WC' . time() . rand(100, 999)`
  - 2.2 Delivery date calculation ‚Üí `$tomorrow->format('Y-m-d')`
  - 2.3 Cart products processing ‚Üí `WC()->cart->get_cart()`
  - 2.4 Customer data extraction ‚Üí `WC()->checkout->get_value()`
- Group 3: PHP ‚Üí JS data transfer
  - 3.1 `snap_params` localization ‚Üí `wp_localize_script('snap-render', 'snap_params', $params)`
  - 3.2 Credential transfer ‚Üí `client_id`, `merchant_id`
  - 3.3 Transaction data transfer ‚Üí transaction array

Phase 2: Payment Method Detection & Form Monitoring (User Interaction)
- Group 4: Payment method selection check
  - `PaymentMethodDetector.isSnapFinanceSelected()` (also dispatches `snapfinance:selected` / `snapfinance:deselected`)
  - Selection events & gating ‚Üí `SnapRender.goIdle()` on deselect; `SnapRender.resumeActive()` on reselect (Blocks wires reselect to container-aware retry)
- Group 5: Event-driven form validation (mirrors WooCommerce validation)
  - 4.1 `FormMonitorUtil.monitorWooCommerceValidation()` observes Woo field classes and validation events (Blocks + Classic)
  - Classic is jQuery-free: native listeners + MutationObserver + `updated_checkout`/`checkout_error`

Phase 3: JavaScript Container Setup (User Selects Snap)
- Group 6: Container preparation & mounting
  - 4.2 Container creation ‚Üí `ensureBlocksContainer()` in `assets/js/blocks.js`
  - 4.3 Container styling ‚Üí `prepareContainer()` in `assets/js/snap-render.js`
  - 4.4 Readiness check ‚Üí `containerIsReady()` in `assets/js/snap-render.js`

Phase 4: SDK Initialization & Availability
- Group 7: SDK wait/ready/init
  - 5.1 `waitForSDK()`
  - 5.2 SDK ready check ‚Üí `typeof snapuk !== 'undefined' && snapuk.checkout.button`
  - 5.3 SDK initialization ‚Üí `_sdkInitialized` flag

Phase 5: Transaction Data Processing (After SDK Ready)
- Group 8: JS-side transaction rebuild
  - 6.1 `window.SnapTransaction.build(snapParams)`
  - 6.2 Invoice caching ‚Üí `makeInvoiceBasis()`, `__snapInvoiceCache`
  - 6.3 Customer data refresh ‚Üí `getCustomer(snapParams)`
- Group 9: Final validation (pre-render)
  - 7.1 `window.SnapTransaction.validate(transaction, snapParams)`
  - 7.2 Amount limits check (Min ¬£250, Max ¬£10,000)
  - 7.3 Status update ‚Üí `updateValidationStatus()`
  - 7.4 Stable transaction hash ‚Üí `stableTxHash()`

Phase 6: Button Rendering (Final Step)
- Group 10: Theme detection & configuration
  - 8.1 `getSnapTheme(snapParams)`
  - 8.2 `theme: this.getSnapTheme(snapParams)` with fallback to DARK
- Group 11: SDK button rendering
  - 9.1 Button config creation ‚Üí `buttonConfig`
  - 9.2 `snapuk.checkout.button(buttonConfig)`
  - 9.3 `_sdkButtonMounted = true`

Phase 7: Post-Render Setup (After Button Appears)
- Group 12: Immediate visibility & validation
  - 10.1 Immediate render call
  - 10.2 Validation overlay ‚Üí `addValidationOverlay()` (handles Shadow DOM)
  - 10.3 Click handler ‚Üí `addClickValidationHandler()` (blocks clicks if invalid)

### Shadow DOM & Button Mounting Assumptions (Critical)
- The Snap SDK mounts the checkout button by attaching a Shadow DOM to the host `#snap-uk-checkout`.
- A host element can only have one shadow root. Any subsequent `snapuk.checkout.button(...)` call on the SAME host that already has a shadow tree will throw:
  - `NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'attachShadow' on 'Element': Shadow root cannot be created on a host which already hosts a shadow tree.`
- Our renderer therefore enforces the following contract:
  - If `#snap-uk-checkout.shadowRoot` exists, REPLACE the host with a fresh `<div id="snap-uk-checkout">` before calling the SDK again.
  - If there is no shadow root yet, we just clear `innerHTML` (no host replacement needed).
  - Post-render verification does NOT re-call the SDK on the same host; it only observes for presence of `shadowRoot`/button to avoid duplicate `attachShadow`.
  - Container readiness is checked and enforced before the SDK call to avoid SVG sizing issues (explicit 300√ó70 and visibility checks).

### Console Log Checklist (to validate the above)
- Selection & gating
  - `üí§ SnapRender: idle (Snap not selected)` when switching away
  - `‚úÖ SnapRender: active (Snap selected)` when switching back
- Container & readiness
  - `‚úÖ STEP 1: Container found: <div id="snap-uk-checkout" ...>`
  - `üîç Container not ready: ...` followed by enforced dimensions
  - `‚úÖ Container is ready - proceeding with SDK call`
- Shadow handling
  - `üßπ Replacing host element to avoid duplicate shadow root` (only when `shadowRoot` already exists)
  - `üßπ Cleared container for fresh render`
- SDK availability & init
  - `‚úÖ STEP 2: SDK fully available immediately (snapuk.checkout.button ready)`
  - `‚úÖ STEP 3: Snap SDK initialized with client_id: ...`
- Transaction & validation
  - `üìã Transaction data for Snap SDK: { invoiceNumber: ..., validationStatus: ... }`
  - `‚Ü∫ Stable transaction unchanged - updating validation messages only` (no full re-render)
- SDK call & post-checks
  - `üéØ STEP 5: Calling snapuk.checkout.button with config: ...`
  - `‚úÖ STEP 5: Rendering Snap SDK button (deferred to next frames)`
  - `‚úÖ STEP 5: SDK snapuk.checkout.button called successfully`
  - `‚ö†Ô∏è Post-render verification: shadow/button not observable yet (no retry to avoid duplicate attachShadow)` OR `‚úÖ Post-render verification: shadow/button present`
- Overlay (invalid state)
  - `‚ùå VALIDATION FAILED: Adding transparent overlay to Snap button`
  - `‚úÖ Validation overlay added successfully`
- Click guard
  - `üñ±Ô∏è Snap button clicked - checking validation state...`
  - `‚ùå Validation overlay detected - blocking Snap application` (until fields fixed)

Notes
- Selection gating: `SnapRender` goes idle when Snap is not selected (cancels retries/timeouts, clears overlays/messages) and resumes cleanly on reselect.
- Validation mirroring: Snap warnings appear/disappear in lockstep with WooCommerce‚Äôs own field validation (Blocks + Classic), without duplicating business rules.
- jQuery-free: All monitoring uses native events and MutationObserver for maximum compatibility.

## üîç **Debugging**

### **Console Messages**
The plugin includes comprehensive step-by-step logging:
- `üéØ STEP 1: Starting Snap Finance render process`
- `‚úÖ STEP 2: SDK fully available immediately (snapuk.checkout.button ready)`
- `‚úÖ STEP 3: Snap SDK initialized with client_id`
- `üéØ STEP 4: Creating transaction data...`
- `‚úÖ STEP 4: Built UK API transaction`
- `‚úÖ STEP 5: SDK snapuk.checkout.button called successfully`

### **Common Issues**
- **SDK Not Loading**: Check console for `snapuk is undefined`
- **Button Not Appearing**: Verify `#snap-uk-checkout` container exists
- **Credentials Error**: Ensure Merchant ID and Client ID are correct
- **Minimum Amount**: Orders under ¬£250 will be rejected
- **Maximum Amount**: Orders over ¬£10,000 will be rejected
- **Pre-selected Method**: Button may not render immediately on page load (known issue)

## üìä **Database Schema**

The plugin creates a `wp_snap_application_details` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_snap_application_details (
    id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    snap_application_id varchar(191) NOT NULL,

    customer_first_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    customer_last_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    customer_phone varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    customer_address text NOT NULL,
    order_total decimal(10,2) NOT NULL,
    cart_id varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
